[Eris Lund (0x5066)](https://github.com/0x5066), the man behind [Winamp 2000 SP4](https://github.com/0x5066/Winamp2000SP4) for giving me a huge head start with development, and implementing many more cool features, like a WMP style visualizer.

[Teil](https://github.com/teil-aidcx), for making the Zune theme a reality.

### TODO:

I might consider making alternative themes in the future:
- Royale theme
- Royale Noir theme
- Embedded theme
- Whistler theme
