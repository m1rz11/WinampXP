WinampXP v1.2
Accurate Windows XP styled skin based on Winamp Classic Modern

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

To install, simply extract the folders to your Winamp skin directory.
Themed versions share code from the base WinampXP skin, so they won't work on their own.

Victhor, the original creator of Winamp Classic Modern, which is the foundation
for this project.

Eris Lund (0x5066), the man behind Winamp 2000 SP4 for giving me a huge head
start with development, and implementing many more cool features, like a
WMP style visualizer.
