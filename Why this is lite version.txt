This skin is aimed to those who love the simplicity of the classic skin but need to jump to a more high-res-friendly or modern design. All features I could replicate from the classic skin are here, even the loading speed, to certain degree. More than this would have feel bloated and unnecessary, so I left it for another version, a full / more complete one that will be launched later (hopefully this year).

This is a short list of features I think it should contain:

. Notification system
. Better Albumart Right-click menu ("Search for cover", "Search lyrics", etc)
. Menu bar on main player (like Big Bento)
. Search in Playlist editor
. Merged mode? (an idea of mine)
. Secret feature on PL (including embeded album art)
. Real-time resize
. 2 modes timer (mm:ss / hh:mm:ss)
. Multi-button bolt
. Color themes window
. Real doublesize
. Beat vis animation on EQ bars
. Custom not-found pics
. XFade button
. EQ toggled on/off signal on main player?
..what else? Any request?
